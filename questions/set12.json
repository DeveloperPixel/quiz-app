    ],
    "answer": "Handling large-scale heterogeneous geospatial datasets",
    "explanation": "Spatial cloud handles massive geospatial data (satellite imagery, LiDAR, GPS streams). The main challenge is heterogeneity (different formats, scales, projections, and resolutions), not just cost or virtualization. Efficient integration and querying of such heterogeneous datasets is a key challenge."
